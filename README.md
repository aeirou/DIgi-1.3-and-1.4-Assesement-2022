Hello, my name is Aeirone Felipe.
Because of my nerdy classmate, I was tempted into creating a GitHub account to track and publish my progress in the Computer Ingineering industry.
I have to say, I know not a lot of things, but I will learn and learn until I have a decent amount of knowledge to be able to at least work independently.
That is all I have to say.

Sincerely, 
aei
